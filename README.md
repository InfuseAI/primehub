# PrimeHub Community Edition

[![Launch Stack](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/cloudformation-launch-stack.png)](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/create/review?stackName=primehub-starter&templateURL=https://primehub.s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation/v1.0.0/primehub-ce-starter-cloudformation.yaml)

Welcome to the PrimeHub Community Edition repository, **PrimeHub** is an effortless infrastructure for machine learning built on the top of Kubernetes. It provides *cluster-computing*, *one-click research environments*, *easy dataset loading*, and *management of various resources* and *access-control*. All of these are designed from *a project/team-centric* concept.

In terms of **PrimeHub CE**, it provides a few fundamental features from [Enterprise Edition↗](https://www.infuseai.io/primehub).

To IT leaders, PrimeHub gives flexibility and administration authority to configure resources and settings for their teams, as well as to pave the way and manage productionized workloads.

To Data scientists, PrimeHub provides Jupyter Notebook-ready environment which is just few-clicks away.

This community repository contains a *Helm Chart* for PrimeHub CE and a guide on how to install PrimeHub CE with *Helm*.

## Fundamental Features

- Opinionated JupyterHub distribution
- Group & user based resource management
- Instance, image & secret management
- Support different types of dataset
- Dataset uploader
- SSH server (allow access into JupyterHub via *ssh* remotely)
