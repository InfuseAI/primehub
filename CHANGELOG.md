      groupVolumeStorageClass: ""
      groupVolumeAnnotations:
        primehub-group-sc: standard
  ```
  or
  ```yaml
  graphql:
    primehubGroupSC: standard

  Please move your overwritten settings into
  ```yaml
  primehub:
    sharedVolumeStorageClass: ""

### Breaking Changes

N/A

### Action Required

- Because `PRIMEHUB_FEATURE_USER_PORTAL` is enabled by default, there are some action required:
  - For default installation, the `PRIMEHUB_SCHEME`, `PRIMEHUB_DOMAIN`, `KC_SCHEME`, `KC_DOMAIN` is required environment now. For definition, please reference [configuration document](docs/administration/configuration.md)
  - modify keycloak client `grafana-proxy` redirect URIs to `https://<PRIMEHUB_DOMAIN>/grafana/*`
- Image has new spec attributes `type` and `urlForGpu` now, those two new attrs are used for seamlessly picking different image by type in spawner. For migrating existing images, please run `modules/upgrade/optional/add_gpu_cpu_type_to_images.sh`
- Set a new environment variable `PRIMEHUB_STORAGE_CLASS`. For rke installation, please set it to `rook-block`. For dev-gcp, set it to `standard`. For dev-gce, set it to `rook-block`. For dev-kind set it to `local-path`. It is the storage class setting for all RWO pvc usage.

## v2.0.0

### Breaking Changes

- PrimeHub is managed by a single meta chart


### Action Required

- **[Downtime Required] Migrate to metachart.** Please follow the instructions in the [migration document to v2.0](modules/upgrade/migrate-v2.0/migrate-v2.0.md)
- **Dataset PVC** Please configure `primehubGroupSC` at etc/helm_override/primehub.yaml. For example, set `standard` storage-class for GKE:
  ```yaml
  primehub-console:
    graphql:
      primehubGroupSC: standard
  ```
  The primehub-console needs a storage-class to create dataset pvc.

Change `starndard` to other pvc storage class if needed.

## v1.8.2

### Security

- [CVE-2019-9512] Upgrade nginx-ingress chart to 1.17.1 (app version 0.25.1)

## v1.8.1

### Bugfix

- Fix the issue that user can't launch instance when its CPU/memory requests are disabled. #ch2475
- Fix group sorting error in spawner page. #ch2471

## v1.8.0

### Action Required

- [Optional] Disable image and instance type customization
  Set env `READ_ONLY_ON_INSTANCE_TYPE_AND_IMAGE=true` will disable image and instance type customization.

- [Optional] For external keycloak installation, install `keycloak-tools` to enable keycloak idempotent upgrades.

  ```
  kubectl apply -f modules/bootstrap/keycloak-tools.yaml
  ```

- [Optional] Apply pod's image mutation

  Label any namespaces which want to apply pod's image replcaing. For example:

  ```
  kubectl label ns hub primehub.io/image-mutation-webhook=enabled
  ```

  In an airgap environment, that should be all namespaces.  This version, it keeps both PRIMEHUB_AIRGAPPED and image-mutation for backward compatible.

- [Optional] Portal Default Cover

  Since 1.8.0, we add serveral default cover images for portal link, you can override ui.portalConfig setup to use it:
    - Gitlab: `/admin/default-covers/gitlab.png`
    - Mattermost: `/admin/default-covers/mattermost.png`
    - Jupyter: `/admin/default-covers/jupyter.png`
  default portal setup in `modules/charts/primehub-console/values.yml`:
  ```
  portalConfig: |
    services:
      # Service portal setup example:
      # - name: Example
      #   uri: "https://example.com"

### Breaking Changes

- Replace admin-ui with primehub-console
- Unify domain name

### Action Required

- **[Downtime Required] Migrate primehub-groupvolume.**

  After upgrade v1.7.0 primehub-groupvolume, need to run migration script to migrate exist project-volume and dataset-volume.

  After migrating primehub-groupvolume until running the migration process, user pod can not access the data in project and dataset volume.

  For the production environment, it's better to schedule downtime upgrade with customer, or we need to let customer known user will encounter data access error during the upgrade process.

  - RKE environment will run `rke_migration.sh` script for migration or follow the migration process provided in `READMD.md`.
  - GKE environment will run `gke_migration.sh` script for migration.
  (See `modules/primehub-groupvolume-nfs/README.md` for more info.)

- **Migrate admin-ui to primehub-console**

  1. Add the environment variables for image pull secret to `.env`

      ```
      PRIMEHUB_CONSOLE_DOCKER_USERNAME=
      PRIMEHUB_CONSOLE_DOCKER_PASSWORD=
      ```

      The value can be found from

      ```
      kubectl -n primehub get secret gitlab-registry -o jsonpath='{.data.\.dockerconfigjson}' | base64 --decode | jq .
      ```

  2. Add the helm override yaml.

      Old sample (admin-ui.yaml):

      ```yaml
      primehub:
        keycloakUrl: https://id.example.com/auth
        adminLocale: en
        adminUrl: https://example.com/admin
        appPrefix: /admin
        crdNamespace: hub
      ```

      Should migrate to new one (primehub-console.yaml):

      ```yaml
      keycloak:
        url: https://id.example.com/auth

      ui:
        locale: en
        url: https://example.com/admin
        appPrefix: /admin

      graphql:
        crdNamespace: hub
      ```

      Before install primehub-console, you should remove old admin-ui release:

      ```
      helm del --purge admin-ui
      ```

- [Optional] User portal page
  1. `PRIMEHUB_FEAURE_USER_PORTAL=true` will enable universal landing page for PrimeHub users.
  2. You can setup items link and welcome messages on landing page in primhub-console.yaml:
  ```yaml
  ...
  ui:
    ...
    portalConfig: |
      services:
        - name: Google
          uri: "https://www.google.com"
          image: "https://www.google.com.tw/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png"
        - name: GitLab
          uri: "https://gitlab.com"
          image: "https://shiring.github.io/tutorials/2017/09/04/GitLab_logo.png"
        - name: JupyterHub
          uri: "https://hub.aaron.dev.primehub.io"
          image: "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*m87_Htb_9Pstq0UcvNJ49w.png"
        - name: Admin Dashboard
          uri: "/cms"
          adminOnly: true
          image: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InfuseAI/primehub/master/docs/media/logo.png"
        - name: Maintenance Notebook
          uri: "/maintenance"
          adminOnly: true
          image: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InfuseAI/primehub/master/docs/media/logo.png"
      welcomeMessage: >
        <h1>Getting Started</h1>
        <div>End of Lines</div>
  ```

- [Optional] Migrate to unified domain name

  1. Add `PRIMEHUB_FEATURE_USER_PORTAL=true`, `PRIMEHUB_DOMAIN=` and `PRIMEHUB_SCHEME=` to `.env`.
  2. Add new [Valid Redirect URIs](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/6.0/server_admin/index.html#oidc-clients) to all affected keycloak clients. (e.g. `admin-ui`, `jupyterhub`, `maintenance-proxy`)
  3. For more information, please see [docs/design/user-portal.md](docs/design/user-portal.md)

## v1.6.2

 - Feature flag to support old convention for group volume [ch1257]
 - Support extra pod and node affinity [ch2667]
 - Upgrade admin-ui to v2.12.5
   - Fixed bug: Attributes in everyone group is removed after editing "Default User Volume Capacity" [ch3007]

### Deprecated

- To keep using legacy project group naming convention, do NOT run `modules/upgrade/optional/kc_group_volume_migration.sh` and need to add `SUPPORT_OLD_GROUP_VOLUME_CONVENTION=true` to your env file. This flag will be applied when you upgrade hub.


## v1.6.0

 - Fixed Bug: metacontroller primehub-group nfs pvc deletion (reproduce) [ch378]
 - Fixed cpu limits configured in group quota are not effective [ch423]
 - Fixed User can't spawn pod because volume manager try to chown everything [ch728]
 - Implement the single upgrade script for PrimeHub [ch294]
 - JupyterLab 404 message patch [ch341]
 - Group volume size & options [ch361]
 - Support Image Pull Secret for Images [ch362]
 - Users in everyone group has no quota by default [ch497]
 - Helm chart for maintenance notebook environment. [ch557]
 - Upgrade nginx-ingress chart to 1.6.16 and increase client-header-buffer-size to 16k [ch708]
 - Implement dataset `launchGroupOnly` in JupyterHub spawner [ch710]
 - Support Maintenance notebook feature. [ch711]
 - Patch rke nginx-ingress configMap [ch713]
 - nvidia-gpu-device-plugin has too small memory limit [ch419]

### Action Required

- In order to make [primehub-admin-notebook](https://github.com/infuseai/primehub-admin-notebook) to work properly,
  You'll have to increase the `client_header_buffer_size` of your nginx-ingress up to `16k`.
  (See `modules/charts/nginx-ingress.yaml` for example.).

  For rke, this change need patch nginx-ingress config map, please run the following command:

  ```
  kubectl -n ingress-nginx patch cm nginx-configuration --type merge -p '{"data":{"client-header-buffer-size":"16k"}}'
  ```

- The system group (`everyone`) now has resource limit by default. In previous version, everyone group has unlimited resource limits. They are now set to `0` by default. If you want to adopt this behavior when upgrading, please source your env file and run `modules/upgrade/optional/kc_everyone_group_default_limit.sh` to apply.

- Groups now have options to enable shared volume (project group) and set volume capacity on Admin UI. In previous version, project groups depend on naming convention that group name starts with `Project-`. To migrate existing project groups to new ones with options, please source your env file and run `modules/upgrade/optional/kc_group_volume_migration.sh`. The migration script will rename existing project groups to remove the prefix `Project-`, so please check if there is any group name conflict by running `modules/upgrade/optional/kc_check_group_names_conflict.sh`.

- Dataset now has option `Launch Group Only` and will display `Mount Root` on Admin UI. To migrate existing datasets, please run `modules/upgrade/optional/add_mount_root_to_datasets.sh`.

### Deprecated

- Project group naming convention is deprecated. Use group options to enable shared volume instead of naming group starts with `Project-`.
